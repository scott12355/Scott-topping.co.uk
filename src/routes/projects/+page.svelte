			Welcome to my chatbot project! This is my first look into NLP chatbot development. Built with
			Python using and using hugging-face spaces to host this model. For the purpose of cheap
			hosting, this particular chatbot is very light weight, so is prone to hallucinations.
		</p>
		<p>
			This chatbot uses the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model. Additionally, my chatbot incorporates a
			sentiment analysis pipeline, allowing it to gauge the tone of your messages and respond
			thoughtfully.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is just the beginning of my exploration into the exciting field of conversational AI. I
			plan to continue building on this foundation, enhancing my skills and creating more innovative
			tools in the future. Thank you for trying it out!
