			Welcome to my chatbot project! This is my first foray into chatbot development, built in
			Python using hugging-face spaces to host this model. For the purpose of cheap hosting, this
			particular chatbot is very light weight.
		</p>
		<p>
			Beyond its conversational capabilities, the chatbot incorporates a sentiment analysis
			pipeline, allowing it to gauge the tone of your messages and respond thoughtfully.\n This is
			just the beginning of my exploration into the exciting field of conversational AI. I plan to
			continue building on this foundation, enhancing my skills and creating more innovative tools
			in the future. Thank you for trying it out!
