    <p>
      I'm Scott, a Computer Science student at MMU with a burning passion for
      technology. My aim is to become a highly skilled software engineer, and
      I'm well on my way to achieving that goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my academic journey, I've not only excelled in my studies but also
      gained valuable real-world experience. I've spent a significant portion of
      my time as a Customer Service Specialist in the health and fitness
      industry, honing my communication and problem-solving skills. Currently,
      I'm embarking on an exciting industrial placement year as a Software
      Engineer with Lloyds Banking Group. Here, I'm putting to use what I have
      learnt at university far into real world applications. Up till now, most
      of my work and learning in my placement has been on the .NET platform.
      Delving deep into the world of WPF applications and TSQL, expanding my
      knowledge and putting my learning to practical use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my career aspirations, I have a few other passions that keep my
      life in balance. Music has always been a source of enjoyment and
      relaxation for me. I'm an avid traveller, eager to explore new cultures
      and broaden my horizons. And when I'm not coding or exploring a new city,
      you can often find me in the theatre, captivated by the magic of
      storytelling. My journey is about continuous learning, growth, and making
      a meaningful impact in the world of technology. Feel free to explore my
      portfolio and discover the projects that reflect my dedication and passion
      for software engineering.
